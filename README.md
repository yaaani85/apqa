# Approximate Proababilistic Query Answering
Probablistic Reasoning over large (uncertain) Knowledge Graphs


## Research Ideas

* Query Optimization (More advanced strategie then: top-k beam search or threshold)
* Scores to Probabilities (Tractor etc / different neural structure)
* End to end learning (aProbLog style backprop)


## Description

Incompleteness brings uncertainity. 
Currently supports two strategies:
* Top-k Beam-Search (CQD)
* Threshold

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Glog
* Glog-Python
* Lib-Kge
* PySDD (WMC)

### Installing

* TODO

### Executing program

* TODO
