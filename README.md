# Approximate Proababilistic Query Answering

Answering Queries with APQA

--> Top-k Beam-Search
--> Threshold > p

Research Ideas:
--> Query Optimization (More advanced strategie then: top-k beam search or threshold)
--> Scores to Probabilities (Tractor etc / different neural structure)
--> End to end learning (aProbLog style backprop)
